        The chart below shows the daily number of cases per country. Additionally, countries are stacked to provide an overview of the 
        global situation. Countries can be selected or unselected from the visualization. Note, by double-clicking on a specific country,
        you can focus on it.

        The Chinese trend looks remarkably different compared to all other countries. Firstly, it is isolated. Indeed, as the virus developed
        initially in China, all other countries have been affected around a month later. Secondly, the chart clearly shows that the rest of
        the world has been struggling with the virus for a noticeable longer time than China.
        <br/><br/>
        On February 12th, China registered 2028 new cases. The next day, there were 15141 new cases, a whopping rise of 646%.
        Unexpectedly, they drastically decrease over 72.5% in the very next day (4156 cases on the 14th of February).
        <br/><br/>
        Globally, the worst day recorded over 100k confirmed case on April 26th.

        The visualization below compares the number of cases with the population and the <span class="ticker" [ngbTooltip]="GDP">GDP</span>
        of the country. The number of cases is normalized based on the population. Continents can be selected and unselected from the
        chart. The goal is to investigate possible correlations between size, wealth, and confirmed cases.

        Firstly, the population size did not affect the spread of the virus. Focusing only on the population and the number of cases,
        points are homogeneously spread around the corresponding plane. This proves there is no significant correlation between them.
        <br/><br/>
        On the contrary, looking at the colors representing the GPD, a clear correlation can be seen between GDP and confirmed cases.
        Richer countries translate into a higher number of cases. This can be explained by the fact that richer countries have better
        health systems. Thereby, they can afford more testing and hospitalization.
